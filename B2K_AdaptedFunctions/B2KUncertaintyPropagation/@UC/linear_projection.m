function [yp, m, b] = linear_projection(x,y,xp)
    % This function takes an x vector and y vector, and their associated 
    % uncertainty vectors, and calculates the uncertainty at a given 
    % extrapolated or interpolated point using a linear fit.
    % All input vectors must be the same length.

% FIND STATISTICAL ERROR IN PROJECTED VALUE ==============================
%  This is related to how 'good' the linear fit to X and Y values is,
%  but does not take into account the uncertainty in the values of X and Y
%  e_yp_stat is 1 standard deviation according to the MATLAB documentation.
%  It does not take the number of points into consideration, with more
%  points, this value approaches the standard deviation of the original
%  dataset.
%
%  This takes the standard deviation and calculates the 95% CI of the mean
%  using the Student's t-distribution.
