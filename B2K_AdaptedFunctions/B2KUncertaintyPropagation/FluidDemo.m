% data is saved in the @Fluid folder)

% Use a GUI for your scripts to select the fluid type if it changes often

% Create a Fluid
f = Fluid(fluid_name);

% Get the density of that fluid
density1 = f.Density({10,'bar'},{280,'K'},'g_L');

% Or using default units (bar, K, kg/m3 or g/L)
density2 = f.Density(10,280);

% Or using arrays for P and T to get a density array
P = 10:1:20;
T = 300*ones(size(P));
density3 = f.Density(P,T);

% If you want the partial derivative of density with respect to P and T
% to use for uncertainty calculations
[rho, drho_dP, drho_dT] = f.Density(10,280);
